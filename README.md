Simulation' project

The essence of the project is a step-by-step simulation of a 2D world populated by herbivores and predators. In addition to creatures, the world contains resources (grass) that herbivores feed on, and static objects that cannot be interacted with - they just take up space.

The 2D world is a NxM matrix, each creature or object occupies a whole cell, it is not allowed to have more than one object or creature in a cell.
